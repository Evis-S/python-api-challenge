Python API Project - What's the Weather Like?

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator


Part 1: WeatherPy
I created  the following plots:
Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
After each pair of plots,I explained what the linear regression is modeling. 


Part 2: VacationPy
I created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df.

I finded the cities with my  ideal weather condition. 
Added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
